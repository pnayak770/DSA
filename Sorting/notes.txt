Sorting :- Sorting is the process of arranging an array in either increasing or decreasing order.


1.Bubble sort :- in this sorting mathod we pick largest element and put in last index of array.
               Complexity: O(n)^2

2.Insertion Sort :- Pick the first element of Unsorted array and place into the sorted array ,  
3.Selection Sort :- Pick smallest number from the unsorted array and place starting of the unsorted array.
                    (Find smallest element index and swap with unsorted array fisrt element)

4.inbuilt Sort : increasing(Arrays.sort(name of array))
                 decreasing(Arrays.sort(arr,Collections.reverseOrder());)

5.lamda function :-this is function we can use to sort a array in diff diff condition.

                   syntax :- Arrays.sort(array name , (a,b)->{
                    return statment according to the condition;
                   })
